We are participating with eMoflon (www.moflon.org).  The following instructions describe how to setup our solution for the Transformation Tool Contest 2014.

(1) Install Moflon IDE plugin for Eclipse

!!NOTE: This step is already accomplished if you use the pre-packaged Eclipse.

For running our soccer client, you need to have the Moflon IDE 
plugin installed. The following URL is the eMoflon Eclipse update site:

http://www.moflon.org/fileadmin/download/moflon-ide/eclipse-plugin/beta/update-site2/

(2) Workspace setup

On the USB stick, you find an Eclipse workspace. You need to import all four (4) projects to Eclipse (or 
simply open the workspace).


(3) After importing, right-click the project 'ttc14_specification' and select 'Moflon > Clean (and Build)'.

(4) Afterwards, run org.moflon.soccerclient.EMoflonTTC2014Main .

It expects two command-line arguments: (1) server hostname and (2) server port.

In case of problems, you can directly contact me via Skype (roland_kluge) or via roland.kluge@es.tu-darmstadt.de .
