TTC 2014 Live Contest Solutions
===============================

This repository is for submitting solutions to the TTC 2014 Live Contest Case.

If you have developed a solution which you want to submit, please tell us so by
creating an issue.  Then we will give you push access so that you can upload
it.

Every solution should be placed in a directory named according to the name of
the used transformation tool.  That directory should contain the solution and a
README file explaining how to run the solution.  The solution must be runnable
without too much hassle, e.g., please include all your dependencies and tools.
A runnable JAR would be fine as would be arbitrary content with a `run.sh`
shell script.
