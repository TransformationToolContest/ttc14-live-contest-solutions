TTC 2014 Live Contest Solutions
===============================

This repository is for submitting solutions to the TTC 2014 Live Contest Case.

How to submit your solution
---------------------------

If you have developed a solution which you want to submit, please tell us so by
creating an issue.  Then we will give you push access so that you can upload
it.

Every solution should be placed in a directory named according to the name of
the used transformation tool.  That directory should contain the solution and a
README file explaining how to run the solution.  The solution must be runnable
without too much hassle, e.g., please include all your dependencies and tools.
A runnable JAR would be fine as would be arbitrary content with a `run.sh`
shell script.

In case of problems (our or your side)
--------------------------------------

So you've uploaded your solution, but you're not done yet.  We will run it as
soon as possible.  If we have problems doing so, e.g., because your solution
crashes, we will create a new issue in this repository's
[issue tracker](https://github.com/TransformationToolContest/ttc14-live-contest-solutions/issues)
mentioning your solution's name in the summary.  So please watch this
repository and issue tracker so that you can help in case there are any
problems.

If it's the other way round, i.e., you have problems submitting your solution,
please also create a new issue in the
[issue tracker](https://github.com/TransformationToolContest/ttc14-live-contest-solutions/issues).
We will come to you as soon as possible.
